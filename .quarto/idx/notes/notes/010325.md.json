If we could solve every medical,\nengineering, and social problem, the benefits would be tremendous.\n\nIf my effort could get us there even one day sooner, it would save thousands of\npeople from trauma. And \"my effort\" here doesn't need to imply that I invent\nAGI. My awareness being centered on anything is a multiplier for global attention.\nThe conversations I have, the energy I put out, the communities I enliven with\nmy participation---all of this has a butterfly effect which transforms the world.\n\nWhen I ask myself---what is the most important thing to work on?---the answer is\nASI. And if the scaling hypothesis is false, and we need different algorithms\nto get us there, then it seems compelling to me to work on this.\n\nBut I'm far from a competent mathematician. But I could become one. Not a great,\nbut at least competent.\n\nThis is where the ego enters the picture. My desire to be great steps in and says\nthat whatever I dedicate my life to ought to be something that I can be great at.\nI don't think that's true objectively. But subjectively I do. From a broader\nperspective I don't think my own greatness matters that much---greatness here\nmeaning social greatness, greatness as social role. But individual greatness and\nsocial greatness are different. I can be great at being me, great at what I do,\nwithout being great within a narrow domain relative to others. You could picture\nthis as being in the third quartile of competency at any given domain I involve\nmyself in, but in the 1% when it comes to overall quality being. I use \"quality\nof being\" here rather than \"quality of life\" because the \"being\" I'm evoking is\na being of action and assertion. The people who are in the 1% of being in the\nworld are different than the 1% richest or the 1% happiest. This seems like a\ngreater goal than narrow greatness. And yet society idolizes the narrowly great.\nI idolize the narrowly great. \n\nThe second reason I'd feel guilty is because this field will clearly be successful\nand I want to participate in its success. Yes, partially out of a desire to\nsatisfy my desire for wealth, and also the gratification of being considered\nbig-brained. It's all shameful but it's all real. But beyond that, there is a\ndesire for the excitement of being part of this bubbling field. I want to talk\nwith people about how to use AI to make the world better. \n\nMaking the world better feels so grand and amorphous that its not only hard to\nknow what one is even implying in that phrase, but also to picture onesself as\naccomplishing such a feat. I do think the benefits in the medical field would\nbe the most profound. I want to solve the mental and physical ailment problem.\nImagine if we lived in a world where we understood the human body so well that\nnone of the physical and mental ailments I or my loved ones have ever experienced\nwere a thing of the past? It's almost incomprehensible how much better the world\ncould be.\n\nIt's difficult grappling with the urge toward high-level thinking and low-level\ncompetency. I seem to be good at building things. I could be much better. But if\nI consider the teams I've been apart of over 2024, I recognize that I'm relatively\ngood at holding many components in my mind. It's hard, and most people aren't\ngood at it. I'm not the best. But it's important to recognize that I'm already\nthird quartile at this.\n\nDefinition: Artificial Super Intelligence is a machine learning system that can\nexponentially increase its ability to model and solve problems, including the\nproblem of accelerating its own capacity to solve problems.\n\nConjecture: Artificial Super Intelligence will be achieved within twenty years.\n\nI think this conjecture is mostly based on excitement. It is exciting that\ntransformers can derive statistical semantics and generatively model them.\n\n## A Counter Position\n\nI have lived the last two years of my life in overall deferrment of gratification.\nI have been living for tomorrow. But in some ways I think it has been desructive\nto my identity. In some ways I find it harder to move through this world as an\nintegrated individual. And I'm undecided whether to say one is delusionional to\nbelievethat integrated individuals exist at all, or to doubt it. At the very\nleast, I have experienced my life dysphorically for its entirety, and I'd rather\nnot. \n\nBut I mean this optimistically---I don't think it's a necessity. It's something\nthat I am inclined to, but I also see a vector leading toward a place of less\ndisphoria and more synchronicity with my environment. \n\nMaybe this is wishful thinking---because I'm actually not sure what that vector\nis. I guess, pragmatically, it would mean focusing my energy outward, on others,\ninstead of so much on myself. Of extending my hand to the world---inviting that\nassociate out for a drink or a meal. Asking that girl out. Making that project\nI'm scared to make. But as I type all this the fantasy of it all becomes clear.\nIt's a projection of my identity onto an imaginary vision.\n\nAll things start with a vision. But still, I recognize the irreality of it.\n\n## So what am I to do?\n\nI want to master software building. I want to build things that are immediately\nuseful. But I also want to contribute to stepping toward artificial super\nintelligence.\n\nIt seems there is still a lot of self-learning I need to do before I can get\nthere. And probably the best use of my energy is in empowering myself and others\nto get to this goal.\n\nI feel conflicted about media, and academia, and entrepreneurship. But I think\nthis is in part because I treat them all as though they are different vectors\nand this creates a tension that pulls me apart and inhibits my progress.\n\nIf I were to step all of these things in the same direction, and throw in my\nneed for artistic fulfillment as well, it would be this:\n\nartistry ->\n\nmedia -> \nacademia -----------|\n                applied ai\nentrepreneurhip ----|\n\n\nIt feels like there's not even a paradigm for what I'm trying to concretize in\nmy mind.\n\nIt's almost like software shamanism. Its a form of \n\n## Fundamentally\n\nFundamentally, a high quality machine learning algorithm is domain agnositc.\nMaybe that's wrong. But math itself certainly is domain agnostic. Not certianly,\nbut apparently---although there are some gaps which we don't seem to necessarily\nbe able to fill with math---such as the realm of the psyche.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I can be a pluralist if I have the right approach.\n\nMusic making is an algorithmic process that is very mathematizable. Storytelling,\nnot so much. But it is not hard to imagine overlapping music, math, and AI.\n\nThe question is: do I even want to do that? Am I only compelled by music for\negotistical reasons? \n\nI think moreso than anything, I desire to be a man on a mission. And for that,\nI need a dream. \n\nI was startled out of my last dream. And now I'm sleep walking.\n\nAs I sit here and think, I find my mind wandering to examples of others\nfrom which to model how I ought to act in the world---who I can be.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"highlight-style":"github-dark","output-file":"010325.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
