The first time I actually enjoyed reading a book that was somewhat technical was when I read the book "Thinking About Mathematics" by Stewart Shapiro.

What stood about to me about his writing was...

But still, Shapiro's book was more philosophical than mathematical.

I went on to read some more technical books that I enjoyed. O'Reilly book publishers have some good stuff. I've found that an O'Reilly book with a lot of five star reviews, a compelling title, and a cool looking animal on the cover to be a good heuristic for choosing my next technical book to read.
