# A Latency free world

Despite how amazing technology is I still find things to complain about all the time.
This is one such complaint: I hate latency.

The experience of something lagging, or even plainly not behaving fast, seems 
fundamentally unnecessary but practically obvious given current tech makes me
long for the user experience of tomorrow when today's tech *just works* and
I'll only have tomorrow's tech to complain about.

What causes latency and how can it be cured? I imagine that its the result of
slow messaging between the client and the server, either due to hardware, memory,
or network issues. Sometimes it's due to the software's code. Maybe there are a
lot of long running processes, or maybe the code isn't optimized for speed, or
the languge itself is slow.
